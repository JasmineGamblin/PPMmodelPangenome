# Inference tool for the PPM model

## Description
This repository contains the source code used in the manuscript 'Persistent, Private and Mobile genes: a model for gene dynamics in evolving pangenomes' by Jasmine Gamblin, Amaury Lambert and Fran√ßois Blanquart.

## Files
- folder `source`: source code for inference tool
- folder `test`: test files containing simulated tree and matrix to run a test inference
- `Makefile`: compilation file
- `simulation.R`: R code used to simulate the PPM model

## Installation and Compilation

### 1. Requirements
- GCC (or other C++ compiler)
- `libtbb` (Intel Threading Building Blocks)

Install TBB on Ubuntu/Debian:
```sh
sudo apt-get install libtbb-dev
```
on Fedora :
```sh
sudo dnf install tbb-devel
```
on macOS :
```sh
brew install tbb
```

### 2. Clone repository
```sh
git clone https://github.com/JasmineGamblin/PPMmodelPangenome
cd PPMmodelPangenome
```

### 3. Compilation
```sh
make
```

## Run inference
To run an inference with a random starting point, use the following command:
```sh
./inference seed "tree.nwk" "pa_matrix.txt" par_nb "mle_param.txt" "inf_cat.txt"
```
where:
- `seed` is the random seed
- `tree.nwk` is the file containing the species tree
- `pa_matrix.txt` is the file containing the presence/absence matrix
- `par_nb` is the number of free parameters (7 or 9, depending if the error parameter is the same for all categories or not)
- `mle_param.txt` is the file where the paramter estimates will be stored
- `inf_cat.txt` is the file where the inferred category for each gene will be stored


To run an inference with a chosen starting point, use instead (example with 9 free parameters):
```sh
./inference 0 "tree.nwk" "pa_matrix.txt" 9 "mle_param.txt" "inf_cat.txt" N0 l0 i1 l1 g2 l2 eps0 eps1 eps2
```
where `N0`, `l0`, `i1`, `l1`, `g2`, `l2`, `eps0`, `eps1` and `eps2` are replaced by the chosen initial values.
